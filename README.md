# 🚀 Docker Projects & Experiments 🐳

Welcome to the Docker Projects Repository! This collection features Dockerized applications, including ML apps, databases, network experiments, and AWS deployments.

Each project showcases real-world use cases of containerization, helping you master Docker for software development & cloud deployments.

## 📚 Learning Resources
Here are some useful resources I frequently refer to:

- 📚 [Official Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/)
- 🎥 [Docker YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/c/Docker)

## 🛠 Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

- ✅ Docker → `docker --version`
- ✅ Python (for Streamlit apps)
- ✅ AWS CLI (for EC2 deployment)
